## Mini Project : Analyzing IMDB Data in Keras


### Project Description

The dataset is the Large Movie Review Dataset often referred to as the IMDB dataset.

The Large Movie Review Dataset (often referred to as the IMDB dataset) contains 25,000 highly polar moving reviews (good or bad) for training and the same amount again for testing. The problem is to determine whether a given moving review has a positive or negative sentiment

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.6 ** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [Keras](https://keras.io)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

We recommend students install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 

### Code

The main code for this project is located in the `IMDB_In_Keras.ipynb` notebook file.
### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `IMDB-Movie-Review-Sentiment/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook IMDB_In_Keras.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook IMDB_In_Keras.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
